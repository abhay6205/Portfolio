            <h3>What I Learned During My AI & ML Industry Training with IBM</h3>
            <p>This summer, I had the incredible opportunity to undergo an industry training program in Artificial
                Intelligence and Machine Learning at Allsoft Solutions, partnered with IBM. Over two intensive months, I
                went from understanding basic data preprocessing to building and evaluating full machine learning
                models. I performed EDA using NumPy and Pandas, trained models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees,
                K-Means, and Ensemble Methods with Scikit-learn, and applied feature engineering to boost model
                performance by 20%. This experience gave me a solid foundation in applying AI/ML to real-world problems
                and solidified my passion for data-driven solutions.</p>

            <h3>My Full Stack Journey: From Python Basics to Cloud Deployment</h3>
            <p>During my Winter PEP training at LPU with Algotutor, I embarked on a comprehensive journey through the
                Python full-stack ecosystem. Starting with core Python concepts — functions, OOP, exception handling — I
                quickly progressed to building web applications with Django, creating REST APIs, setting up CI/CD
                pipelines with GitHub Actions, and containerizing applications with Docker. The most rewarding part was
                seeing how all these pieces fit together: writing clean Python code, structuring it into a Django
                project, exposing it via APIs, and deploying it to the cloud. This training transformed my understanding
                of modern software development workflows.</p>
